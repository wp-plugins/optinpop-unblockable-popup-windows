What OptinPop gives you is the ability to leverage the huge popularity of blogs into massive subscriber lists and more blog traffic.

We guarantee that nothing can block your message - It's totally unstoppable by any popup blocker or website browser...

== What Else Is Possible With OptinPop? ==

**Transform any WordPress blog into a listbuilding super tornado...**
This incredibly easy to use plug-in puts your listbuilding on overdrive within 10 minutes of installing it.

**Turn casual browsers into responsive subscribers and buyers...**
Convert more traffic into high converting subscribers before they've even seen your blog.

**Command "Red Hot" high quality traffic...**
When you build a list using my WordPress plug-in you'll never have to worry about the lack of traffic ever again.

**Make your blog visitors offers they simply can't refuse...**
Anyone leaving your website might think that it's all over. That changes when you use my new plug-in that gives you one last chance to command your exit traffic's attention.

**Here are some ideas for your OptinPop window...**

**Idea 1: Create an optin form to build your list:**
Gaining a new subscriber can be more valuable than a new sale and this is one of the most powerful ways to do it.

**Idea 2: Offer a coupon code to gain more sales:**
Just as your visitor is about to leave your blog make them an offer they can't refuse. This could be a discounted price or an added bonus, but only if they order (or subscribe) now.

**Idea 3: Ask why people are leaving:**
Set your popup window to appear only when your visitors leave your blog and find out why they decided to leave. Use your blog visitors feedback to make your blog outsell your closest rival, hands down... every time.

**Idea 4: Show visitors your multi-media content:**
You can put anything in your popup window... audio, video and flash animations are no exceptions. Why not give all your new blog visitors a chance to get to know you with an audio or video message as soon as they arrive?

**Idea 5: Show visitors a banner ad:**
Why not show your visitors a banner ad when the arrive at or go to leave your website. This turns OptinPop into a potential money maker for you as you convert your existing blog traffic into additional affiliate commissions or extra sales of your own products.
